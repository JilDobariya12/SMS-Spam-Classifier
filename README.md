# SMS Spam Detection 📩🚫

This project builds a machine learning model to detect spam messages in SMS texts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms.

## 📌 Features

- Text preprocessing using NLP (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, stemming)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Training classification models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, and recall
- Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- numpy
- matlplotlib
- streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
